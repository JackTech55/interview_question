## üí∞ Salary and Ranking Problems

### 1. ü•à Find the 2nd Highest Salary from Employee Table

**Scenario:** You have an employee table and need to find the employee with the second-highest salary.

**Sample Data:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

INSERT INTO employees VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', 'Engineering', 75000),
(2, 'Jane Smith', 'Engineering', 85000),
(3, 'Bob Johnson', 'Marketing', 65000),
(4, 'Alice Brown', 'Engineering', 95000),
(5, 'Charlie Davis', 'Marketing', 70000),
(6, 'Eva Wilson', 'HR', 85000);
```

**üìã Multiple Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Using LIMIT with OFFSET**
```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
```

**Solution 2: Using Subquery**
```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary = (
    SELECT salary 
    FROM employees 
    ORDER BY salary DESC 
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
);
```

**Solution 3: Using Window Functions (MySQL 8.0+)**
```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM (
    SELECT name, salary,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank_num
    FROM employees
) ranked
WHERE rank_num = 2;
```

**Solution 4: Using MAX() with Subquery**
```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary = (
    SELECT MAX(salary)
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees)
);
```

**üéØ Result:** Alice Brown, 95000 (if we want 2nd highest unique salary)

---

### 2. üèÜ Find Nth Highest Salary in Each Department

**Scenario:** Find the 3rd highest salary in each department.

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Using Window Functions (Recommended)
SELECT department, name, salary
FROM (
    SELECT department, name, salary,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) as dept_rank
    FROM employees
) ranked
WHERE dept_rank = 3;

-- Alternative: Using Correlated Subquery
SELECT e1.department, e1.name, e1.salary
FROM employees e1
WHERE 3 = (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e2.salary)
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e2.department = e1.department
    AND e2.salary >= e1.salary
);
```

---

### 3. üìä Find Employees with Salary Above Department Average

**Scenario:** List all employees whose salary is above their department's average salary.

**Solution:**
```sql
SELECT e.name, e.department, e.salary, dept_avg.avg_salary
FROM employees e
JOIN (
    SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department
) dept_avg ON e.department = dept_avg.department
WHERE e.salary > dept_avg.avg_salary;

-- Alternative using Window Functions
SELECT name, department, salary, avg_dept_salary
FROM (
    SELECT name, department, salary,
           AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as avg_dept_salary
    FROM employees
) emp_with_avg
WHERE salary > avg_dept_salary;
```

    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    total DECIMAL(10,2)
);

INSERT INTO customers VALUES
(1, 'John Smith', 'john@email.com'),
(2, 'Jane Doe', 'jane@email.com'),
(3, 'Bob Wilson', 'bob@email.com'),
(4, 'Alice Brown', 'alice@email.com');

INSERT INTO orders VALUES

(2, 2, '2024-01-20', 200.00),
(3, 1, '2024-02-01', 175.00);
```

**Solutions:**
```sql
-- Solution 1: LEFT JOIN with NULL check
SELECT c.id, c.name, c.email
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.customer_id IS NULL;

-- Solution 2: NOT EXISTS
SELECT c.id, c.name, c.email
FROM customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o 
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.id
);

-- Solution 3: NOT IN (be careful with NULLs)
SELECT c.id, c.name, c.email
FROM customers c
WHERE c.id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT customer_id 
    FROM orders 
    WHERE customer_id IS NOT NULL
);
```

('2024-01-06', 1300.00),
('2024-01-08', 800.00);
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Find consecutive sequences using LAG/LEAD
SELECT 
    sale_date,
    total_amount,
    CASE 
        WHEN DATEDIFF(sale_date, LAG(sale_date) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date)) = 1 
        THEN 'Consecutive'
        ELSE 'Gap'
    END as sequence_status
FROM daily_sales
ORDER BY sale_date;

-- Find start and end of consecutive periods
WITH consecutive_groups AS (
    SELECT 
        sale_date,
        total_amount,
        sale_date - INTERVAL ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) DAY as group_date
    FROM daily_sales
)
SELECT 
    MIN(sale_date) as sequence_start,
    MAX(sale_date) as sequence_end,
    COUNT(*) as consecutive_days,

## ‚ö° Performance and Optimization

### 11. üöÄ Optimize Slow Query with Large Dataset

**Scenario:** You have a slow query that joins multiple tables. Optimize it.

**Original Slow Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    c.name as customer_name,
    COUNT(o.id) as total_orders,
    SUM(o.total) as total_spent
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
LEFT JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY c.id, c.name
HAVING total_orders > 5;
```

**Optimized Solutions:**
```sql
-- Solution 1: Pre-filter before joining
WITH filtered_orders AS (
    SELECT customer_id, id, total
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
),
customer_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        COUNT(*) as total_orders,
        SUM(total) as total_spent
    FROM filtered_orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
)
SELECT 
    c.name as customer_name,
    cs.total_orders,
    cs.total_spent
FROM customer_stats cs
JOIN customers c ON c.id = cs.customer_id;

-- Solution 2: Add proper indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date ON orders(customer_id, order_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_order_id ON order_items(order_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_product_id ON order_items(product_id);
```

### 12. üîç Find Missing Sequential IDs

**Scenario:** Find missing ID numbers in a sequence.

**Sample Data:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_ids (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY
);

INSERT INTO user_ids VALUES (1), (2), (3), (5), (6), (8), (10);
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Generate sequence and find missing numbers
WITH RECURSIVE number_sequence AS (
    SELECT 1 as num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT num + 1
    FROM number_sequence
    WHERE num < (SELECT MAX(id) FROM user_ids)
)
SELECT ns.num as missing_id
FROM number_sequence ns
LEFT JOIN user_ids ui ON ns.num = ui.id
WHERE ui.id IS NULL;

-- Alternative using self-join to find gaps
SELECT (u1.id + 1) as missing_start,
       (MIN(u2.id) - 1) as missing_end
FROM user_ids u1
LEFT JOIN user_ids u2 ON u1.id < u2.id
WHERE u1.id + 1 NOT IN (SELECT id FROM user_ids)
GROUP BY u1.id
HAVING missing_start <= missing_end;
```

**Scenario:** Transform rows to columns (pivot operation).

**Sample Data:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_data (
    year INT,
    quarter VARCHAR(2),
    sales_amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);

INSERT INTO sales_data VALUES
(2024, 'Q1', 100000),
(2024, 'Q2', 120000),
(2024, 'Q3', 110000),
(2024, 'Q4', 130000),
(2023, 'Q1', 90000),
(2023, 'Q2', 95000),
(2023, 'Q3', 100000),
(2023, 'Q4', 105000);
```

**Solution:**
```sql
SELECT 
    year,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q1' THEN sales_amount END) as Q1_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q2' THEN sales_amount END) as Q2_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q3' THEN sales_amount END) as Q3_sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q4' THEN sales_amount END) as Q4_sales,
    SUM(sales_amount) as total_yearly_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;

-- With percentage calculations
SELECT 
    year,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q1' THEN sales_amount END) as Q1_sales,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q1' THEN sales_amount END) / SUM(sales_amount) * 100, 2) as Q1_percent,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q2' THEN sales_amount END) as Q2_sales,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q2' THEN sales_amount END) / SUM(sales_amount) * 100, 2) as Q2_percent,
    SUM(sales_amount) as total_yearly_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY year;
```

(3, 'Bob Johnson', 'HR', 55000, 4.5),
(4, 'Alice Brown', 'Engineering', 80000, 3.2);
```

**Solution:**
```sql
UPDATE employee_performance
SET current_salary = current_salary * (
    1 + 
    CASE 
        WHEN department = 'Engineering' AND performance_rating > 4 THEN 0.15
        WHEN department = 'Engineering' AND performance_rating > 3 THEN 0.10
        WHEN department = 'Marketing' AND performance_rating > 4 THEN 0.12
        WHEN department = 'Marketing' AND performance_rating > 3 THEN 0.08
        WHEN department = 'HR' AND performance_rating > 4 THEN 0.10
        WHEN department = 'HR' AND performance_rating > 3 THEN 0.05
        ELSE 0
    END
);

-- Verify the updates
SELECT 
    name,
    department,
    current_salary,
    performance_rating,
    CASE 
        WHEN department = 'Engineering' AND performance_rating > 4 THEN '15%'
        WHEN department = 'Engineering' AND performance_rating > 3 THEN '10%'
        WHEN department = 'Marketing' AND performance_rating > 4 THEN '12%'
        WHEN department = 'Marketing' AND performance_rating > 3 THEN '8%'
        WHEN department = 'HR' AND performance_rating > 4 THEN '10%'
        WHEN department = 'HR' AND performance_rating > 3 THEN '5%'
        ELSE '0%'
    END as raise_percentage
FROM employee_performance;
```

### 17. üîç Find Overlapping Date Ranges

**Scenario:** Find overlapping booking periods in a hotel reservation system.

**Sample Data:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE bookings (
    booking_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    room_id INT,
    guest_name VARCHAR(100),
    check_in DATE,
    check_out DATE
);

INSERT INTO bookings VALUES
(1, 101, 'John Smith', '2024-01-01', '2024-01-05'),
(2, 101, 'Jane Doe', '2024-01-03', '2024-01-07'),
(3, 101, 'Bob Wilson', '2024-01-08', '2024-01-12'),
